Place for my ideas, resources and discussions

Live in New York City. 26 years old. Sort've a music enthusist. Explored the world of modeling, interned with film and record companies and chose a Public Relations Specialist career path after college. I've degrees in Media Communications and Entertainment Business which make for joyously, insane but welcoming "work"..
